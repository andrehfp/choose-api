# Choose your API!

Choose your API, a project where you can choose from any of the three APIs
and see their data independent from fields, sources and anything like that.

You can choose between real estate from two companies (built by myself) and fake comments
from blog posts.

## Stack:
* NodeJS
* React
* Ant Design

## What you can do:
* You can sign up, log in and log out from the application
* As a visitor, you can choose between the sources, search, order, paginate
* As a logged in user you can favorite items from various sources and see your favorites list in one list, independent of the sources.
* In your favorites list, you can search and order by any field, independent of the source
* Data persists after page reload (localstorage being used)

## Data
* All the data is saved in localstorage, but can easily be turned into sql or noSql storage

## Challenges
I'm fairly new to React (1~2 years of light experience), but it was great to put my skils to test. Still gotta a lot to learn, but it was fun. 
And, as any dev project, there's always something more to do.

## What can be improved
* Using cache to retrieve data from the APIs quicker
* Using CRUD ready or similar (i.e Firestore) to store and retrieve data instead of localstorage
* UI/UX definetly
* Keep an open field for API endpoint request and create pages for APIs dynamically
